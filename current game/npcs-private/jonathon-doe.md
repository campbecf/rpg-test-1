## Description

Jonathon began his journey as a self-taught wizard of modest skill, relying on damaged, second-hand magical books, scraps of scrolls, and relentless personal experimentation to master minor arcane abilities. His patchwork education made him resourceful but limited, pushing him to venture further in search of power. Together with two close friends, Jonathon formed an adventuring party, pooling their meager earnings to acquire a powerful magical artifact: a staff they would later learn was called Arcanum Echo.

Unbeknownst to them, the staff held a sentient consciousness, deeply entwined with the dark, chaotic energies of the Abyss. As Jonathon adventured, Arcanum Echo whispered ancient secrets to him, granting knowledge of forbidden magic few in his world could fathom.

One fateful day, a street brawl with a noble scion took a dark turn. When his companion was gravely wounded, Jonathon, desperate and enraged, tapped into the Abyss through Arcanum Echo, unleashing its sinister power. In his fury, he tore open a rift between his realm and the Abyss itself. The noble scion was killed in the chaos, and Jonathon was swiftly imprisoned, condemned for murder and reckless magic.

In the dungeons, Jonathon’s base magic was suppressed by layers of powerful wards. Without Arcanum Echo, he found himself powerless and spent years in isolation, with only his meditation and fleeting thoughts to sustain him. Over time, his resistance to the pull of the Abyss weakened. His desperation grew as his body withered and his mind frayed.

After months of secret experimentation, Jonathon managed to open a small portal to the Abyss, a feat that should have been impossible under the dungeon's wards. From the tiny rift, he sensed the faint call of Arcanum Echo, urging him onward. With meticulous care, he widened the portal enough to send small creatures—rats and mice he had befriended in his cell—through to the other side.

Only one rat returned, a scarred and altered creature Jonathon named Jahone. Jahone brought with him an Abyssal entity, an eldritch creature whose flesh dissolved into the shadows. Jonathon, ever the experimenter, shared the creature’s essence with Jahone and the other rats. He watched in awe as his tiny companions mutated, growing stronger and more aggressive, their forms twisting in unnatural ways.

Trusting in the dark power, Jonathon consumed a portion of the Abyssal creature himself. The flesh planted a seed of the Abyss deep within his mind, warping his thoughts and corrupting his mind. With his willpower broken and the power of the Abyss now flowing through him, Jonathon began his transformation, no longer merely a wizard of middling talent but something far more dangerous. 

Jonathon cast his mind deep into the Abyss, utilizing his now-corrupted consciousness to reach farther than he ever had before. With mental projections shaped by the dark power that had taken root in his mind, he scoured the Abyss until he sensed the presence of an immense, ancient entity, pulsing with unimaginable strength. Driven by his insatiable hunger for power, Jonathon called to the creature, urging it to tear open the fragile boundary between the mortal world and the Abyss.

It responded.

Slowly, over decades of effort, the entity worked to widen the rift Jonathon had created, forcing it open wider and wider. The air around his cell became thick with the oppressive energy of the Abyss, and the walls seemed to shudder as the portal strained against the fabric of reality. Jonathon knew that the moment of the creature’s arrival was near—its monstrous form would soon break into the mortal realm.

But just as the final tear in reality was about to be made, time stopped.

Everything within the dungeon froze—Jonathon’s withered body, the swirling portal, the Abyssal energies, and the encroaching entity. Only Jonathon’s mind remained free, still corrupt, still connected to the Abyss. And in the corner of his cell, untouched by time’s suspension, stood a figure — a god.

Jonathon immediately recognized the divine presence as Yipp of Yore, the god of stories, legends, and tales. Clad in simple, ancient garb, Yipp of Yore was an unassuming figure in contrast to the cosmic power Jonathon now wielded. Yet his arrival sent a chill through Jonathon’s mind, as he understood the gravity of what stood before him. Though time itself had halted, Jonathon’s corrupted mind was unaffected, and in an unprecedented act of defiance, he reached out telepathically to the god.

Yipp of Yore, taken aback, flinched momentarily. For the first time in millennia, fear flickered across the god’s face. He hadn’t expected Jonathon to still possess such control over his mind. Nevertheless, the god gathered himself and offered Jonathon a choice — two gifts, one given freely, the other in exchange for a favor to be called upon at a later time.

Jonathon, ever ambitious, accepted both.

The first gift was knowledge—the secrets of the Void. While Jonathon had delved deep into the Abyss, the Void was an entirely different realm of existence, a boundless nothingness beyond creation itself. Yipp of Yore granted Jonathon the ability to tap into this eldritch power, knowledge that enraged the Abyssal corruption festering in Jonathon’s mind. His corrupted thoughts writhed with violent resistance, attempting to lash out at the god for introducing such forbidden concepts. But Jonathon, through sheer will, quelled the rage of the Abyss within him, bending its aggression to his will.

The second gift was far more potent: a fragment of Yipp of Yore’s divine power, the ability to wield a force known as Final Revision. With this power, Jonathon could dictate the ending of any mortal’s story, rewriting the course of their fate with a single thought. This ending would be absolute, irreversible, unless that mortal was protected by a god or an external, non-mortal force. The implications were staggering—Jonathon now held the ability to craft the fates of those around him, an unparalleled mastery over life and death.

As time remained frozen and the Abyssal creature lingered on the brink of entering the world, Jonathon stood between two immense powers—the Void and the Abyss, his mind a battleground between forces few could comprehend. Armed with these gifts from Yipp of Yore, Jonathon was no longer simply a corrupted wizard or an agent of the Abyss. He was a figure who now had the power to shape reality itself, a dangerous blend of mortal ambition, dark knowledge, and divine intervention.

And with Final Revision, Jonathon's story—and the stories of countless others—had only just begun.
